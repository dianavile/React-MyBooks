# React-MyBooks Project
This code is created with the starter template for MyReads (project 7) for Google Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship at Udacity.

# MyReads Goals
* Add interactivity to the static app in CSS and HTML markup
* Refactor the static code into React code
* Break User Interface (UI) into Components Hierarchy
* Create new JS files for each component
* Organize shelves by categories
* Add a SearchPage and a BookPage.
* Add a button to each book element to assign shelf to a book
* Include import/require statements
* Identify the state and the state position, Add the State to creative dynamic components.
* Check if data flows correctly: one way direction from parent to child.

### My Reads Functionality
- My Reads is a bookshelf app to select & categorize books. 
- The main page displays a list of three "shelves" (categories):
  - Currently Reading
  - Want to Read
  - Read
- Each self contains a number of books.
- Each book contains a control to select the shelf.
- The Default value for the control is the current shelf the book is in.

## Installation & Start Project

To get started developing:
* clone or download the project from within __React/MyBooks__ file.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server
The project comes with a given backend server to develop against. 
The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:
* [`getAll`](#getall)
  Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.
* [`update`](#update):update(book, shelf)
* book: `<Object>` contains an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request
* [`search`](#search): search(query)
* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. Books need to have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

### Code dependencies
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 
- More information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

- The project is based on the [Udacity starter code] (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

And further uses the following __code dependencies__:
 * "prop-types": "^15.6.1",
 * "react": "^16.3.2",
 * "react-dom": "^16.3.2"
 * react-scripts": "1.1.4
 * start": "react-scripts start
 * build": "react-scripts build
 * test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom
 * eject": "react-scripts eject
